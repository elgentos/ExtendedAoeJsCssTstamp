# elgentos ExtendedAoeJsCssTstamp

This extends the behavior of [Aoe_JsCssTstamp](https://github.com/fbrnc/Aoe_JsCssTstamp/) to also version files that are added through `addJs` instead of `addItem`, in both the frontend as well as the backend.

Example before;

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.example.com/js/prototype/prototype.js"></script>`

Example after;

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.example.com/js/prototype/prototype.1478599408.js"></script>`
